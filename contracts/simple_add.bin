# This is a binary representation of a simple addition contract
# PUSH 10, PUSH 20, ADD, HALT

# The actual binary content would be:
# 01 0A 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  (PUSH 10)
# 01 14 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  (PUSH 20) 
# 03                          (ADD)
# 18                          (HALT)

# For demonstration purposes, this file contains the hex representation
# In a real implementation, this would be actual binary data
